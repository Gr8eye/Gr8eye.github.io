--------
My name is Meghan Felker, currently studyding Data Science at Lambda School, it's pretty awesome!
I am also a writer, alias [Maitland Greye](https://maitlandgreye.wordpress.com/), my favourite genres are Fantasy and Sci-Fi. 
Were I to have my greatest dream come to fruition, I will be the creator of the first universal language and I'm just determined
enough to achieve that one. 

May or may not be a polymath. More likely jack of all trades and master of none.
